   Data Comparison

   Pair Approach:
   Map input records: 10,000
   Map output records: 10,413,148
   Map output bytes: 177,023,516
   Reduce input groups: 291,600
   Reduce input records: 10,413,148
   Reduce output records: 291,060
   Total time spent by all map tasks: 149,999 ms
   Total time spent by all reduce tasks: 34,500 ms
   Spilled Records: 20,826,296
   Shuffled Maps: 10
   Failed Shuffles: 0
   Stripe Approach:
   Map input records: 10,000
   Map output records: 309,820
   Map output bytes: 125,273,176
   Reduce input groups: 540
   Reduce input records: 309,820
   Reduce output records: 291,060
   Total time spent by all map tasks: 87,917 ms
   Total time spent by all reduce tasks: 18,707 ms
   Spilled Records: 619,640
   Shuffled Maps: 10
   Failed Shuffles: 0


   Comparison conclusion:
   Map Output Records: Pair Approach generated significantly more map output records compared to the Stripe Approach.
   Reduce Input Groups: Pair Approach had a higher number of distinct reduce input groups compared to the Stripe Approach.
   Total Time Spent: Both approaches had similar total time spent by all map tasks and reduce tasks, with the Stripe Approach being slightly faster.
   Spilled Records: Pair Approach had a larger number of spilled records compared to the Stripe Approach, indicating more data had to be written to disk during the shuffle phase.
   Map Output Bytes: Pair Approach had a larger amount of map output bytes compared to the Stripe Approach.
   Overall, the Stripe Approach seems to have performed more efficiently in terms of map and reduce tasks, with fewer spilled records and a faster total processing time.
